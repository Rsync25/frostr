# FROSTR

Use Flexible Round Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) signatures to create a threshold multisignature (t-of-n) and post nostr events with your friends.

** Extremely unsafe and violently untested **

Please do not add this to any nostr client list.

## Usage

cargo run
```
Choose menu options 0-1, copy-paste and share things between participants. Take care of only sharing "secrets" with the intended recipient!
